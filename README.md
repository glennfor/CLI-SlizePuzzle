# CLI-SlizePuzzle

[Demo](./demo/slide-puzzle-demo.mp4)

## About the slide puzzle

This is a small slide puzzle. The console manipulations are windows specific but
can be easily replaced with curses or some other console manipulating lib.

## Running

- Clone this repo on windows
- Compile with `g++ main.cpp -o main.exe`
- Run with `./main.exe` on CMD or PSH

## Notes

There is room for some novel feature like

- improving animations
- adding more styling to the interface
- adding in a little windows programming such as messageboxes to get input
- adding timer ‚è≤
